        <h1> Book Review: The island of the missing trees.</h1>

        <h3>Sneak Peak of the review!</h3>
        <p>
            Ms. Elif is a believer of the inherited pain, and this book is about the same, in humans, in animals and in
            plants. The island of the missing trees is a historic fiction with the background set during 1974 Cyprus
            conflict. The protagonists of the story are Kostas, a Greek Christian, Defne, a Turkish Muslim and a Fig
            Tree (to be precise a female fig tree). The two teenagers with contrasting personalities fell in love,
            during the time they shouldn't. The book narrates their journey, through their perspectives and from the
            fig's point of view. How amid the communal tension and conflicts in Cyprus, the lovers had to part ways and
            how having lost their love they found themselves?</p>

        <h3>The Review: How I felt after reading the book?</h3>

        <p>My very first thought was, how less I know about the past, the people and their pain. I had read about the
            holocaust, the nuclear attacks and as an Indian, about the communal riots happened during Indian
            Independence. I had not heard of Cyprus conflict. I couldn't fathom about Muslims and Christians fighting. I
            don't know why, I simply never thought they could. But then something happens, it had happened everywhere,
            when good neighbors and friends turned against each other.</p>

        <p><b>My review?</b>

            How Elif has personified the fig, is marvelous. Narration is fresh and compelling. Vocabulary used is
            decent. Ms. Elif is a renowned writer and her work has been published in more than 50 languages. This fact
            itself states that her writing approaches her readers. I would surely recommend this book to all my fellow
            readers.</p>
